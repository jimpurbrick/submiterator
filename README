Submiterator is both a simple example app for people wanting to quickly get a 
Facebook web application up and running and a useful app for people at 
hackathons to register their hacks.

To run Submiterator first set up a Facebook application at 
https://developers.facebook.com/apps then follow the instructions for setting 
up a Flask app on Heroku at https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python but
upload (a fork of) the code at https://github.com/jimpurbrick/submiterator
instead of a new empty repro.

The following environment variables need to be set up in the Heroku 
environment using Heroku config:

HACK_NAME (Namespace used to associate data with a hack, eg "EPFL")
SECRET_KEY (Arbitrary application secret key)
FACEBOOK_APP_ID (Generated by developers.facebook.com on app creation)
FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET (Generated by developers.facebook.com on app creation)
MYREDIS_URL (Generated by addons.heroku.com when MyRedis addon selected)

For local development, these environment variables can be added to a .env file
which is read by Foreman start and dev.submiterator.herokuapp.com can be added
to the local hosts file to allow authentication with Facebook from the local 
machine.

The production Submiterator app runs at https://submiterator.herokuapp.com

Submiterator was based on the Flask-Oauth Facebook example by mitsuhiko 
(https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-oauth/blob/master/example/facebook.py)
